# aws-alcolizer-rekognition
The objectives of this project are to encourage every Fortescue team member to self-test at the Alcolizer wall mounted breathalysers so that Fortescue will know who has completed a breath test and whether a positive result was returned.

This software project will capture the email, parse the json attachment, store the reconstructed photos and data, and use the AWS Rekognition service to identitfy the the Fortescue Team member who took the test.
